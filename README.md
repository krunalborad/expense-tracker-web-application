Super excited to share a project that helped me sharpen both frontend and backend skills — a full-stack Expense Tracker Web App built with MERN stack! 💰📊
I built a full-stack Expense Tracker Web App to help users take control of their personal finances — in real time, with an intuitive interface and powerful features.
In today’s fast-paced world, managing expenses efficiently is a necessity. So I built an expense-tracking web app that lets users keep a real-time record of their income and spending with a clean, intuitive UI.


💻 Built using MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), the app allows users to:
• Add, view, edit, and delete transactions
• Categorize expenses and incomes
• Visualize insights using charts & summaries
• Track monthly savings and goals
• Enjoy a clean and responsive UI for any device

🎨 Special focus was given to UX/UI design, ensuring a smooth and accessible experience for all users.

🔐 Backend services handle secure data management and optimized APIs for seamless interactions.

🔐 Security was a key focus — the app includes:
• User authentication system with JWT tokens
• Secure password storage using bcrypt hashing
• Protected routes to ensure safe access to user-specific data

🖥️ Key Features:
• Add/edit/delete income & expenses
• Visual insights using charts and summaries
• Monthly filtering and category-wise breakdown
• Responsive design for mobile and desktop
• Protected login/register system

🛠️ Tech Stack
• Frontend: React JS, Tailwind CSS
• Backend: Express JS, Node JS
• Database: MongoDB
• Authentication: JWT + Bcrypt
• UI/UX: Responsive design, chart visualization (Recharts/Chart.js)
• Architecture: REST API with modular structure
